            MY FAVOURITE <br> IS HYDERABAD
        </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p id="hyd">I like Hyderabad because it has more monuments upto 19 monuments.Even Hyderabad is famous for its food,culture, its language and etc. Its historic sites include Golconda Fort, a former diamond-trading center that was once the Qutb Shahi dynastic capital. The Charminar, a 16th-century mosque whose 4 arches support towering minarets, is an old city landmark near the long-standing Laad Bazaar.And my cousins live there, even I like the resturant which is Paradise Biryani Resturant I love there's butter nan and chicken curry.Along with its delicious Mughlai food, Hyderabad is also famous all over the world due to Nizami Tehzeeb. Hyderabad is like a paradise for the taste lovers. The delicious Biryani and the fragrance of Paya here attracts tourists from far and wide to Hyderabad. On seeing the hospitality and food of the Nawabi of Hyderabad, you will also feel that you have really come to the city of a Nizam. Hyderabadi cuisine has a broad Islamic influence on traditional Andhra and Telangana cuisine. There are many restaurants serving Hyderabadi cuisine. All hotels in the city have one or more restaurants that are popular. Chef, Paradide, Hyderabad House are some of the famous restaurants serving Hyderabadi cuisine. The food in Hyderabad is lovely so I like Hyderabad because I am Foodie.</p>
